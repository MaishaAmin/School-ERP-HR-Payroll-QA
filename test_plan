# Test Plan – Supply Chain Management (SCM) Module

## Project Overview
The SCM module manages procurement, inventory, and order fulfillment processes. The goal of testing is to ensure reliable operations and accurate data flow between procurement, stock management, and order processing.

## Objectives
- Verify correctness of procurement workflows (purchase requisition, purchase order, goods receipt).
- Validate inventory updates after goods receipt and issue.
- Ensure accurate order creation, fulfillment, and invoicing.
- Test integration between SCM and Finance modules.

## Scope
**In Scope:**
- Procurement: PR → PO → GRN workflow
- Inventory: Stock updates, transfers, and adjustments
- Order Management: Order creation, status tracking, and fulfillment
- Reporting: Inventory reports, procurement analytics

**Out of Scope:**
- Third-party logistics system integration
- Performance/stress testing

## Test Approach
- Manual testing for functional workflows
- API testing for stock synchronization (Postman)
- Regression testing for core features during updates

## Deliverables
- Test Cases for SCM workflows
- Bug Reports with severity & priority
- Test Summary Report

## Entry Criteria
- Requirements approved
- SCM module deployed in QA environment
- Test data available

## Exit Criteria
- All high & medium severity defects resolved
- >95% test case execution completed
- Sign-off from stakeholders

## Risks & Mitigation
- **Risk:** Data sync delays between SCM and Finance  
  **Mitigation:** Perform API-level validation and mock data testing  
- **Risk:** Incomplete test data  
  **Mitigation:** Prepare sample master data before test execution

## Roles & Responsibilities
- QA Engineer: Design test cases, execute tests, report bugs
- Developer: Resolve defects
- Business Analyst: Validate requirements and clarify conditions

# Test Plan – Finance & Accounting (F&A) Module

## Project Overview
The F&A module manages financial transactions including accounts receivable, accounts payable, general ledger, and reporting. Testing ensures financial accuracy, compliance, and integration with other ERP modules.

## Objectives
- Validate financial workflows including invoicing, payments, and reconciliations.
- Ensure accuracy of General Ledger (GL) postings.
- Verify data flow between F&A, Payroll, and SCM modules.
- Test financial reporting for accuracy and compliance.

## Scope
**In Scope:**
- Accounts Receivable: Invoice creation, payment collection
- Accounts Payable: Vendor invoices, payment posting
- General Ledger: Journal entries, reconciliations
- Reports: Balance sheet, P&L statement

**Out of Scope:**
- External accounting system integration
- Performance load testing

## Test Approach
- Manual functional testing of core finance workflows
- API testing for data sync between modules
- Exploratory testing for edge cases in financial calculations

## Deliverables
- Finance test cases
- Bug reports with detailed defect logs
- Test Summary Report

## Entry Criteria
- Business requirements finalized
- Test environment set up with finance data
- Access to integrated Payroll and SCM modules

## Exit Criteria
- 100% of critical test cases executed
- No high-severity open defects
- UAT sign-off received

## Risks & Mitigation
- **Risk:** Incorrect financial data migration  
  **Mitigation:** Run reconciliation scripts before test execution  
- **Risk:** Misconfigured tax rules  
  **Mitigation:** Validate with test data across multiple scenarios

## Roles & Responsibilities
- QA Engineer: Prepare finance-related test cases, execute, and report bugs
- Finance SME: Validate accuracy of financial results
- Developer: Fix reported issues
